# Paint App (demo)

## Academic Integrity Policy

In accordance to UofT's CSC207 Academic Integrity policy, I cannot disclose any implementation details in this repository, but I will be open to discuss this project in an interview.

---

## Overview

This repository contains a **demonstration video** of my paint application project for CSC207. I implemented this project in Java with two other teammates.

This project demonstrates my understanding of **OOP design principles**, mainly Strategy, Factory, Observer/Observable. 

This application supports basic paint features **except for the polyline feature** which we could not implement due to the time constraints and other internal team issues.

## Features

* **Shapes:** circle, ellipse, square, rectangle, triangle, squiggle
* **Undo/redo** action
* **Fill/outline styles**
  * fill
  * outline
  * both
* **Canvas colour** selection

---

## Project architecture

### Design patterns used
* **Factory**: creating a shape
* **Strategy**: updating a shape
* **Observer/Observable**: rendering a shape
* **MVC**: overall program structure

### Framework used

For the GUI we used JavaFX.

## What I learned from this project

Over the course of this project I learned how agile development works, how git version control works, the main design patterns and how to use them, and GUI implementation.

## Key takeaways from this project

* **Technical**: Design patterns improve code readability and modularity.
* **Agile development**: With agile development, always keep the team updated, set an ideal work pace, and ask for updates from team members to make changes to the plans if necessary.
